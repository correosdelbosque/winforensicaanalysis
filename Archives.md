Most of the archives provided in the code repository are associated with the books I've written.  For example, the wfa3e.zip archive contains the materials associated with the book, [Windows Forensic Analysis Toolkit 3rd edition](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Forensic-Analysis-Toolkit-Third/dp/1597497274/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1342573478&sr=1-1&keywords=carvey), and RR.zip contains the materials associated with the [Windows Registry Forensics](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Registry-Forensics-Advanced-Forensic/dp/1597495808/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1342573478&sr=1-2&keywords=carvey) book.

The available archives will have a short description associated with each file, so look to those descriptions to see what you can expect to find in the archives.
